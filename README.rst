Contributing

If you are using the gnat-stimgen to generate experimental blocks for a new
language pair (e.g. an adaptation, extension or replication of one of our
studies), you're more than welcome to make a pull request for the new language
pair file. However, if the logic of the block generation is altered (i.e.
your experimental design is different in some way) then it's best to make a
fork. It would still be great to give us a ping so we can link to your fork.
